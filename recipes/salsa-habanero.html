        <p>
            Need to add some kick to a dish? a few drops of this will do it. 
            The longer you roast the peppers the darker and more complex the salsa will be.
            You can also skip the roasting entirely for a brighter, sweet 'n spicy salsa - fresh habaneros
            have a naturally sweet flavor in them that pairs well with fruits such as mango and pineapple.
            If you prefer a milder salsa, you can remove the seeds or simply wait a few days.
            By the end of the week, the heat level will have toned down on its own.
